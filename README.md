# Clean your git commit history

## Edit last commit

1. When you forget to include changes or files in your latest commit, use `git commit --amend --no-edit` to quickly add them without changing the commit message. 🛠️💡

2. Remember to exercise caution, especially if the commit has been pushed to a shared repository. ⚠️🚫

3. Always review your changes thoroughly before amending a commit to ensure a smooth version control workflow. 👀✨🔎

## Edit a Previous Commit

1. When you need to fix or modify a previous commit, the `git commit --fixup` command comes to the rescue. It allows you to make necessary adjustments without creating a new commit. 🛠️💡

2. By using `git commit --fixup`, you can associate your changes directly with the commit that requires fixing. This approach helps maintain a clean and organized commit history. 👥✨

3. It's important to note that when using `--fixup`, you should review your changes thoroughly to ensure they address the issues in the target commit accurately. This ensures a smooth version control workflow. 👀🔎✅
