# Clean your git commit history

## Edit last commit

1. When you forget to include changes or files in your latest commit, use `git commit --amend --no-edit` to quickly add them without changing the commit message. 🛠️💡

2. Remember to exercise caution, especially if the commit has been pushed to a shared repository. ⚠️🚫

3. Always review your changes thoroughly before amending a commit to ensure a smooth version control workflow. 👀✨🔎
